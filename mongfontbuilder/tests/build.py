"""Build the fonts this project composes, without running the suites.

The suites compose the same fonts on the way to shaping them, which is a run of thousands of
cases: this builds them and stops. Nothing here shapes anything, so a change to a drawing or
to a layout of the font is built rather than checked — no case of the suites writes
punctuation, so for one, the conformance run says nothing about the vertical forms of the
marks.
