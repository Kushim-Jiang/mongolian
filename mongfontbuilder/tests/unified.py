        A drawing is read along the line, and a vertical form is read along the line by its y
        axis, which is the direction the layout takes its advance in. A font that gives a
        glyph no vertical advance of its own gives every glyph the height of the line — from
        the ascender to the descender — and the source font draws each vertical form in that
        box, wherever in it the mark belongs.

        A vertical form is given `VERTICAL_HEIGHT` as its height first, which is what makes
        the font carry `vmtx` at all: a glyph whose height is set has a vertical advance of
        its own, and the layout then reads the glyph by the line the font gives it rather
        than by a vertical origin it synthesizes. The synthesized origin is what a reading
        is otherwise placed by, and it is taken across the line from the width of the glyph
        rather than from the drawing, so a vertical form read without `vmtx` does not keep
        the margin it is drawn with. The height is the same for every form, so `vhea` is
        written once and every vertical form shares the line.

        A horizontal form of this font is drawn with the margin the mark is read with: its
        ink runs from `VERTICAL_MARGIN` to the advance less `VERTICAL_MARGIN`, so the mark is
        read with the same margin before it and after it and nothing else. A vertical form is
        the same mark turned onto the line, so it is read with that same margin at each end
        of it along the line. The advance of a vertical form is therefore set to its drawing
        plus `VERTICAL_MARGIN` at each end of it, and the drawing is moved so that it sits
        `VERTICAL_MARGIN` from the start of that advance.

        Both are proportional placements: values the layout reads rather than ink on the
        glyph. The drawing is what the source font drew, and the placement is what `vpal` is
        for; the advance a glyph of this font is looked up with is the height of the line, so
        the placement is what the advance of the form is read as.

        The placement is written for the default script as well as for the Mongolian one.
        A layout reads the placement of the script its text is written with, and only the
        writing systems of this font are registered under `mong`; a layout that resolves
        its text to another script — or to no script at all — reads `DFLT`, and a `vpal`
        of the Mongolian script alone would be a placement that layout never reads. The
        box of a vertical form is a property of the form itself, so it is written once for
